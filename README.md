# CMOS-Inverter-Design-and-Analysis-using-Sky130pdk
 Design and Analysis of a CMOS inverter using the sky130 pdk and open source tools
 This project investigates the electrical characteristics of NMOS and PMOS transistors and applies the extracted device parameters to the design and analysis of a CMOS inverter. Simulations are carried out using the SKY130 open-source Process Design Kit in conjunction with open-source EDA tools. The inverter is evaluated under both static and dynamic operating conditions to determine its voltage transfer behavior, noise margins, delay, and power consumption. The influence of transistor sizing and load capacitance on inverter performance is also examined. Pre-layout and post-layout simulation results are compared to assess the impact of parasitic effects.
